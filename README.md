# Terraform Multi-Cloud POC

## Overview

This project serves as a Proof of Concept (POC) for utilizing Terraform to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud environments. The goal is to demonstrate how Terraform can provision and manage resources in a multi-cloud setup efficiently.

## Project Description

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to showcase the capabilities of Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code (IAC) tool for orchestrating resources in various cloud providers. By deploying resources across multiple cloud environments, we aim to:

- Validate Terraform's multi-cloud capabilities.
- Provide a starting point for managing infrastructure across different clouds.
- Encourage best practices for Terraform configuration and multi-cloud deployments.

### Cloud Providers

This POC currently supports provisioning resources in the following cloud providers:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Terraform Multi-Cloud POC:

1. **Installation**:
   - Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) on your local machine.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Set up credentials for the cloud providers you intend to use. Refer to each provider's documentation for details.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Customize the Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, etc.) to specify the resources you want to create in the respective cloud environments.

4. **Initialization**:
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory. This step will download necessary provider plugins.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Run `terraform apply` to create the defined resources in the cloud environments. Review the plan before applying changes to ensure they align with your intentions.
